# macky_xml
My xml library

Uses nom and everything else is hand-written, supports basic querying. Check my ComicCron repo for an example of how to use it, I made this since nothing else did exactly what I needed it to - parse xml, html, and unclosed img elements in RSS cdata descriptions into a simple and easy to use rust format
